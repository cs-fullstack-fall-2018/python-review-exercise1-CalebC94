# Python_Practice
Practice using functions, if, and loops.

##### Phase 0:
Print “Loop”

##### Phase 1:
Create a program that takes user input. Print “Loop”. Nothing is done with the user input yet.

##### Phase 2:
Create a program that takes user input and prints the user input.

##### Phase 3:
Create a program that takes user input in a while loop. If they enter ‘q’ or 0 (your choice), quit. Inside the loop print “LOOP”

##### Phase 4:
Create a program that takes user input in a while loop. If they enter 1, print 1. If they enter 2, print 2. If they enter 3 print 3. If they enter ‘q’ or 0 (your choice), quit. Else, print “ERROR”.

##### Phase 5:
Create a program that takes user input. If they enter 1, call a function that prints 1. If they press 2, call a function that prints 2. If they press 3, call a function that prints 3. If they enter ‘q’, quit. Else, print “ERROR”.
